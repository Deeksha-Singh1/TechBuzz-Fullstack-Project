        <h1><b>Top 3 Starbucks Interview Questions</b></h1>
    <ul>
        <li> <h2> How would you handle a customer who claims their drink order is wrong?
        </h2>
        <h3>“If a customer said that their drink was wrong, I would first ask them to tell me about the issue. I’d need to know what they ordered originally as well as what is wrong with the beverage. If the drink was different from what they ordered, I would proceed with making the right one immediately. If the problem was more nuanced, I’d ask them to describe what they aren’t enjoying about the beverage. That way, if a specific kind of correction needed to be made, like an adjustment to the temperature, amount of flavoring, or something a bit nuanced, I could remake their drink to their satisfaction.”
            </h3></li>
        <li>
            <h2> If a customer picked up their drink, took a sip, and became visibly unhappy, but didn’t approach an employee about it, what would you do?</h2>
            <h3>“If a customer didn’t seem happy with their drink, I would reach out and ask if they weren’t enjoying their beverage. My hope would be that they could describe what was wrong, giving me insight into what may have gone awry. Once I had that information, I would offer to remake their beverage right away, using their input as a guide for the next drink. That way, they could have a beverage they enjoy. It’s a simple step that could significantly improve their experience, so it’s one worth taking.”
            </h3>
        </li>
        <li><h2> What is your favorite drink at Starbucks?
        </h2> 
            <h3>My favorite Starbucks drink during the cooler months is the white chocolate mocha with whip. It gives me a pleasant pick-me-up but also feels like a treat. That makes it functional and indulgent, especially on a cold day. But, if it’s warmer, I enjoy the vanilla sweet cream cold brew. It’s rich, decadent, and gives me a great energy boost.”
