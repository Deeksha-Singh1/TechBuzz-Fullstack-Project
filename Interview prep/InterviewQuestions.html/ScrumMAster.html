      <h1><b>Top 3 Scrum Master Interview Questions</b></h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h2>1. Are Agile and Scrum the same thing? Why or why not?</h2>
          <h3>
            “Agile and Scrum aren’t exactly the same thing. Agile is a set of four core values and 12 principles, each designed to encourage greater efficiency and reduce risk. The group of methodologies and tenets focuses on iterative approaches and creating collaborative, cross-functional teams that promote success.
            Scrum falls under the larger Agile umbrella, serving as a framework to ensure teams can become or remain Agile. Essentially, it’s a subset that provides a bit more specificity, outlining specific practices, like the use of sprints, to keep the team Agile.” 
          </h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>
            2. In your own words, what does a Scrum Master do?
          </h2>
          <h3>
            “A Scrum Master’s core responsibility is to make sure that the team adheres to the Scrum framework. A significant part of the job involves guiding and coaching others, facilitating success by ensuring everyone remains focused and that their efforts are coordinated. In the simplest terms, Scrum Masters handle the process, relying on their framework expertise and leadership capabilities to ensure everyone else follows the proper workflows.”
             
          </h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>
            3. Can you describe how you would lead a daily Scrum meeting?
          </h2>
          <h3>
            “For the daily Scrum meetings, I begin with a quick overview of the tasks that were planned for the previous day. After that, I ask each team member to discuss whether they met their goals for that day. Next, I request an overview of what they plan on tackling today, as well as if they are facing any challenges that could make achieving their objectives difficult. Finally, I would work with the team to consider how various obstacles could be overcome, increasing the odds of overall success.”
