        <h1><b>Top 3 Lowe's Interview Questions</b></h1>
    <ul>
        <li> <h2> If a customer has a question about a DIY project and you didn’t know how to answer it, how would you proceed?

        </h2>
        <h3>“If a customer asked me for guidance, and I was unsure about how they should proceed, the first thing I would do is make sure I understood their request. I would summarize what they shared and would ask clarifying questions to ensure I fully understood. At that point, I would turn to various resources to find an answer. This could include an employee knowledge base, details off of the Lowe’s website, or coworkers who specialize in projects of that nature. My goal would be to stay with the customer, navigating through, and tapping additional resources until a suitable answer is found.”
            </h3></li>
        <li>
            <h2>When you have to do repetitive tasks, what do you do to stay motivated?
            </h2>
            <h3>“When I am assigned a task that is repetitive in nature, I keep myself motivated by focusing on the importance of the activity. While it may not be the most exciting, that doesn’t make it any less critical to operations. By doing my best, I’m ensuring that I excel in the role and that my employer can thrive. Ultimately, it’s my passion for excellence that keeps me moving forward, regardless of the nature of the task.”

            </h3>
        </li>
        <li><h2>If a manager told you to do something that was unsafe, what would you do?

        </h2> 
            <h3>
                “If a manager asked me to do something unsafe, my first step would be to ensure I understood what was actually being requested. There’s a chance I misinterpreted the situation, so I would summarize what I was told and ask clarifying questions as needed. If it was clear that the task or approach was unsafe, I would voice my concern calmly and professionally. I would concentrate on using neutral language and would rely on facts. If applicable, I would also bring up relevant company policies that discuss such actions. Then, I would attempt to present an alternative that ensured the task could be completed in a safe manner. My goal would be to be cooperative and collaborative so that a solution could be identified. If that did not yield results, and the manager insisted I act in an unsafe manner, I would reach out to a higher-up or safety manager for guidance.”
