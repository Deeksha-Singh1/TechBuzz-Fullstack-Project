        <h1><b>Top 3 Target Interview Questions</b></h1>
    <ul>
        <li> <h2> 1. What would you do if an angry customer became verbally abusive?
        </h2>
        <h3>“If a customer became aggressive, my first priority would be to remain calm. I don’t want to escalate the situation, so I would be mindful of my body language and speaking tone. My goal would be to remain kind and empathetic, listening to their concerns, rephrasing them and asking clarifying questions to ensure I understand, and trying to find a reasonable resolution. If I am either unable to calm the customer or find a solution, I would follow company policy and contact a supervisor or manager.”
            </h3></li>
        <li>
            <h2>2. If a customer is looking for a product, but is having trouble describing it, what would you do? </h2>
            <h3>“If a customer couldn’t remember the name of a product they want to find, I would begin by asking them to describe it as well as they can. That alone may be enough to point me in the right direction. However, if it isn’t, I would then move on to clarifying questions. For example, I may ask them how they envision using the item or what task they are trying to accomplish. By learning about their goals, I could narrow down the options and potentially determine what they want to find. If it is still not clear, I would coordinate with my coworkers, especially if someone has expertise in the product category in question. However, I would stay with the customer to ensure their needs are met, seeking out additional assistance as necessary.”
            </h3>
        </li>
        <li><h2>3. Tell me about a time when you were innovative on the job.</h2> 
            <h3>“In my last position, handling incoming inventory was cumbersome. Everything would arrive in a group of boxes, but the items weren’t always separated into departments. Initially, each box was handled individually. After confirming the contents were correct, the products would get dispersed. Then, the next box would be handled. I noticed that this was very inefficient, as it had people bouncing back and forth to the same sections repeatedly. I spoke with my manager and discussed a process that involved sorting all of the contents before bringing any of the new inventory to the floor. That way, an entire department would be handled in one trip, speeding up the entire process overall.”
                </h3>
