      <h1><b>Top 3 Facebook Interview Questions</b></h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h2>
            1. Describe the personality of a manager who you’d never want to work for.

          </h2>
          <h3>
            “Generally, I’m pretty adaptable. However, I think I would struggle if I were working for a manager that didn’t provide constructive feedback. I believe that feedback is an opportunity to learn and grow, but it can only serve that function if it is actionable and can help me enhance my capabilities. As a result, a manager that prefers to berate over being supportive is not ideal for me.”
          </h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>
            2. Are there any duties you absolutely hate doing?
          </h2>
          <h3>
            “Generally, I don’t enjoy highly repetitive tasks. However, I realize that there are many instances where that’s unavoidable. As a result, I developed a system that allows me to remain engaged. After working on a repetitive task for a period, I transition over to a different duty for a time. This gives me a mental break from the less-engaging activity while ensuring I remain productive. Then, I switch back, allowing to me return with renewed vigor and focus.”
          </h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>3. Are you able to remain productive while working from home?</h2>
          <h3>
            “Yes, I feel that I am capable of not just remaining productive but exceeding expectations while working remotely. I set myself up for success by making the most of a range of tools. For example, to support organization and time management, I use a calendaring app to structure my workday. Additionally, I have a quiet space from which to work, ensuring I can focus, and take active steps to limit distractions, such as turning off unnecessary notifications.
I’m also highly tech-savvy and adapt quickly to remote work solutions like collaboration software and VPN connection services. I believe that, together, that ensures I can remain productive.”
