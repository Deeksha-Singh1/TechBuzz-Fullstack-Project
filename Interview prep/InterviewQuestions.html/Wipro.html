        <li>
          <h2>1. Tell me about yourself.</h2>
          <h3>
            This is the first and foremost question asked in most of the
            interviews. The question is pretty straight forward. But the answer
            to this question is very important because it can make or break
            their impression on you. The way to start this answer is to start
            talking about your name, educational background, and family
            background. Then you can talk about your interests in general. You
            can also mention the skills that you have. Here, you can mention the
            projects that you have worked on. In all probability, they may ask
            you questions related to these. You need to be very careful while
            answering questions related to the projects that you have worked on.
            For candidates who have mentioned their strengths and weaknesses,
            the interviewer may ask you about your plan to control your
            weakness. Then you should be ready to tackle that question. Our
            advice is to practice in front of a mirror talking to yourself for
            at least half an hour every day. This will help you frame your
            sentences. You can conclude the discussion by mentioning one of your
            hobbies.

            You should be able to convince them that you are bound to stay with
            the company for a longer duration. In order to do that you can
            something like "I want to be more skillful, more confident and
            holding a good position in your company." Or you can say something
            like " I want to be a good asset to the company and be part of the
            company for years to come.

          <h2>3. Why should we hire you?</h2>
          <h3>
            The interviewer is trying to assess your worthiness for their
            company. So, you need to convince them. You can start your answer by
            saying "I am a fast learner and I can grasp something that is new to
            me. Remember it is not just the words but the way you speak is also
            very important. Articulation is very important when speaking with
            someone. You can also mention i) Problem-solving skills ii)
            Leadership skills.
          </h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>4. What are your strengths and weaknesses?</h2>
          <h3>
            The answer to this question should not make you sound overconfident.
            At the same time, mentioning your weaknesses should not make you
            sound terrible. Being honest is good. But being too honest may not
            benefit you during the interview. Some of the strengths that people
            mention in an interview are:- i) Patience. ii) Communication skills
            iii) Creativity. iv) Attention to detail. Some of the weaknesses
            that people mention in an interview are as follows. i) Sensitive.
            ii) Fear of speaking in front of an audience. iii) Over focused.
            While it is good to state your weaknesses, it is also important to
            tell them what you have been doing to overcome them. That is when
            they will look at you as an individual who is constantly trying to
            improve himself.

        <li>
          <h2>Question 1. Memory Management In C ?</h2>
          <h3>
            The C programming language manages memory statically, automatically,
            or dynamically. Static-duration variables are allocated in main
            memory, usually along with the executable code of the program, and
            persist for the lifetime of the program Automatic-duration variables
            are allocated on the stack and come and go as functions are called
            and return. For static-duration and automatic-duration variables,
            the size of the allocation is required to be compile-time constant.
            Dynamic memory allocation in which memory is more explicitly (but
            more flexibly) managed, typically, by allocating it from the heap,
            an area of memory structured for this purpose. In C, the library
            function malloc is used to allocate a block of memory on the heap.
            The program accesses this block of memory via a pointer that malloc
            returns. When the memory is no longer needed, the pointer is passed
            to free which deallocates the memory so that it can be used for
            other purposes.

          <h2>Question 2. Functionality Of Operating System?</h2>
          <h3>
            An operating system (OS) is a set of software that manages computer
            hardware resources and provides common services for computer
            programs. To act as interface between hardware and users, an
            operating system must be able perform the following functions: 1.
            Enabling startup application programs. Thus, the operating system
            must have: A text editor A translator An editor of links 2. The
            allocation of resources needed to execute programs is done by
            identifying: the programs that are running, the need for memory,
            peripheral devices and data protection requirements. 3. Facilities
            for data compression, sorting, mixing, cataloging and maintenance of
            libraries, through utility programs available. 4. Plan
            implementation works according to certain criteria, for efficient
            use of central processing unit. 5. Assisting implementation of
            programs through computer-user communication system, at both
            hardware and software level. Examples of operating
            systems:BS2000,BS3000,DOS,PC-DOS,MS-DOS,LINUX,SOLARIS,MAC

          <h2>Question 3. What Is The Use Of Ip Address.?</h2>
          <h3>
            An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label
            assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer) participating in a
            computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for
            communication.An IP address serves two principal functions: host or
            network interface identification and location addressing.

          <h2>
            Question 4. What Is Difference Between Unique And Primary Key
            Constraints?
          </h2>
          <h3>
            A UNIQUE constraint is similar to PRIMARY key, but you can have more
            than one UNIQUE constraint per table. Contrary to PRIMARY key UNIQUE
            constraints can accept NULL but just once. If the constraint is
            defined in a combination of fields, then every field can accept NULL
            and can have some values on them, as long as the combination values
            is unique.

            Question 6. What Is The Difference Between Interface And Multiple
            Interface?
          </h2>
          <h3>
            Both an abstract class and an interface are specific types of
            computer objects that allow a programmer to loosely define one type
            of object as if it were another type, while retaining all of the
            object's original properties. While multiple different computer
            languages use one or both of these concepts, Java is the most
            well-known. Abstract classes and interfaces have a variety of
            similarities, but also incorporate significant differences in
            structure, syntax, and usage.

        <li>
          <h2>Question 9. What Do You Meant By Active And Passive Objects?</h2>
          <h3>
            Active objects are one which instigate an interaction which owns a
            thread and they are responsible for handling control to other
            objects. In simple words it can be referred as client. Passive
            objects are one, which passively waits for the message to be
            processed. It waits for another object that requires its services.
            In simple words it can be referred as server.

            Question 10. What Do You Meant By Static And Dynamic Modeling?
          </h2>
          <h3>
            Static modeling is used to specify structure of the objects that
            exist in the problem domain. These are expressed using class, object
            and USECASE diagrams. But Dynamic modeling refers representing the
            object interactions during runtime. It is represented by sequence,
            activity, collaboration and statechart diagrams.

        <li>
          <h2>Question 11. What Is Program Counter?</h2>
          <h3>
            Program counter holds the address of either the first byte of the
            next instruction to be fetched for execution or the address of the
            next byte of a multi byte instruction, which has not been completely
            fetched. In both the cases it gets incremented automatically one by
            one as the instruction bytes get fetched. Also Program register
            keeps the address of the next instruction
          </h3>

        <li>
          <h2>Question 14. Is Xml Case-sensitive?</h2>
          <h3>
            XML is case sensitive when uppercase and lowercase characters are
            treated differently. Element type names, Attribute names, Attribute
            values, All general and parameter entity names, and data content
            (text), are case-sensitive.
          </h3>

        <li>
          <h2>Question 15. What Is A Null Object?</h2>
          <h3>
            It is an object of some class whose purpose is to indicate that a
            real object of that class does not exist. One common use for a null
            object is a return value from a member function that is supposed to
            return an object with some specified properties but cannot find such
            an object.
