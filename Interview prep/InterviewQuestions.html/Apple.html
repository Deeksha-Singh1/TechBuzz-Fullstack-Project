      <h1><b>Top 3 Apple Interview Questions</b></h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h2>1. What is your favorite Apple product, and why?</h2>
          <h3>
            “While I’m a fan of several Apple products, I’d have to say my favorite is the Apple Watch. It enables me to be more efficient both in my personal and professional lives. The ability to stay apprised of incoming messages and respond to them without having to dig out another device lets me work faster. Plus, receiving calendar reminders through the watch is great for time management, ensuring I stay on target even on the busiest days.”

          <h2>
            2. Have you ever disagreed with your manager about a decision? How did you handle the situation?
          </h2>
          <h3>
            “In my last position, our team was working on a project when a last-minute feature addition request came in. My manager wanted to adjust the project to accommodate the feature, something that I disagreed with. I was concerned about the impact on the timeline and overall workload, as well as possible reductions in final product quality if we were pushed to meet the original deadline.
I discussed my thoughts with my manager, providing an overview of the potential negative impacts of the change based on data. While they choose to move forward with the feature, the data I provided did cause my manager to rethink the original timeline. In the end, the team was given an extended deadline, reducing some of the strain and giving us the ability to deliver a high-quality result.”

          <h2>3. Do you take any steps to enhance your skills outside of work?</h2>
          <h3>
            “Yes, I do take steps to ensure my skills remain current, if not on the cutting-edge. I take advantage of a variety of online learning resources and sign up for industry publications to ensure I remain aware of emerging trends. Additionally, I enjoy doing my own side projects, giving me a chance to put new skills to work or keep my existing ones sharp.”
