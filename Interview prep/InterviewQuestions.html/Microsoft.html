        <li>
          <h2>
            Do you use Microsoft products or services? If so, which is your
            favorite, and why?
          </h2>
          <h3>
            “Yes, I use Microsoft products and services. If I had to pick a
            favorite, I would choose Microsoft Office 365. I appreciate any tool
            that allows me to work efficiently. Since documents created with
            Office 365 are cloud-stored, I can access them with any
            internet-connected device, including while on the goal. Since time
            management and adhering to deadlines is critical to me, it’s an
            ideal solution that ensures I can continuously exceed expectations,
            no matter where the day takes me.”

            How do you build and maintain functional relationships with
            colleagues working in other locations?
          </h2>
          <h3>
            “I’ve found that communication is the key to building and maintain
            all professional relationships, particularly when working with
            colleagues in other locations. In my last role, I made use of a wide
            variety of platforms to remain connected with my coworkers. I found
            collaboration software to be incredibly beneficial, allowing us to
            have off-the-cuff discussions, share documents, and more.However,
            since having strong bond can boost our effectiveness, I also took
            additional steps to forge meaningful connections. For example, I
            coordinated monthly video-based team gatherings that were more
            casual. This allowed us to have a virtual water cooler-esque
            experience, adding a social element that made us feel like a
            cohesive unit.”

          <h2>
            What steps do you take to keep your skills current?

          </h2>
          <h3>
            I use several approaches to ensure my skills remain current and relevant. First, I subscribe to industry newsletters and follow thought leaders on social media. This allows me to stay apprised of emerging trends, creating opportunities for me to discover new skills that, while they may not be critical today, could be vital tomorrow.
            Additionally, I’m constantly studying and honing my skills. I read articles, take advantage of free online learning resources, and handle personal projects in relevant niches. This allows me to learn, grow, and enhance what I bring to the table, ensuring my capabilities are always up-to-date, if not on the cutting-edge.”
