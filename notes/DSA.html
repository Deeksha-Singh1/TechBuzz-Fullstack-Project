    <h2>What is Data Structures and Algorithms?</h2>
    Data Structures are structures programmed to store ordered data so that various operations can be performed on it easily. <br> It represents the knowledge of data to be organized in memory. It should be designed and implemented in such a way <br> that it reduces the complexity and increases the efficiency. <br><br>
