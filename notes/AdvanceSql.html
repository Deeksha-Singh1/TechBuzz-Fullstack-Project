    <ul>
      <li>Special value that is supported by SQL is called as null which is used to represent values of attributes that are unknown or do not apply for that particular row</li>
      <li>For example age of a particular student is not available in the age column of student table then it is represented as null but not as zero
        </li>
      <li>It is important to know that null values is always different from zero value</li>
      <li>A null value is used to represent the following different interpretations
        <ul>
          <li>Value unknown (value exists but is not known)</li>
          <li>Value not available (exists but is purposely hidden)</li>
          <li>Attribute not applicable (undefined for that row)</li>
        </ul>
